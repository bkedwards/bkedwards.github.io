    <p><strong class="passion">Passion.</strong> <br /><br />  It’s the driving force behind everything I do — from building immersive interfaces to 
      exploring new technologies just for the thrill of learning.</p>
    <p> <br /> I approach each project with creativity and curiosity, constantly seeking better ways to express ideas through code. 
      My journey is defined by a relentless desire to learn, grow, and create with purpose.</p>
    <p> <br /> I'm deeply passionate about using technology as a medium for creativity and problem-solving. Whether I'm exploring new frameworks, building interactive visual experiences, or diving into complex systems, I thrive on turning ideas into something tangible. I approach every project with curiosity and an eagerness to learn, constantly pushing myself to grow both technically and creatively. For me, the process of learning isn’t a task — it's a mindset that fuels everything I do.</p>
